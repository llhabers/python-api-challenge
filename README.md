## Observations from WeatherPy

### WeatherPy - I was asked to select 500+ cities at random from around the world. With this data, I had to create varies graphs on the following;

#### Temperature (K) vs. Latitude
#### Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
#### Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
#### Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude

### After completing WeatherPy, I noticed four trends.

#### Trend 1 - There is a strong correlations between Latitiude and temperatures.

#### Trend 2 - The closer a city is to the equator, (Latitude = 0) the warmer the city.

#### Trend 3 - There is no strong correlation between Latitude and Cloudiness.

#### Trend 4 - There is no strong correlation between Latitude and Wind Speed.

## Heatmap for VacationPy is saved as a png in the output_data folder as "VacationPy_Maps".
